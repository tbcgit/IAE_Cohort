We start from the table of 16S taxonomic counts at genus level, reduce it to a presence/absence table using the  "Convert2Jaccard.py" script and then the "Calcula_jaccard.R" code is used to produce the jaccard metric. All present in the "Get_Jaccards" directory.

After that we used the resulting Jaccard matrix to generate the Figure4.
